 Description : Breast Cancer Prediction using Machine Learning # {{{

This project explores the **Breast Cancer Wisconsin Diagnostic Dataset** to build a machine learning model that can classify tumors as *malignant* or *benign*.
The goal is to demonstrate end-to-end ML workflow:

    1. Data loading & cleaning
    2. Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
    3. Preprocessing
    4. Model training
    5. Model evaluation
    6. Insights and conclusions

Such predictive modeling can support early detection and assist healthcare professionals, though models should **never replace medical diagnosis**.

We start by loading the cleaned breast cancer dataset.
Each row represents a tumor with various features extracted from digitized images of a fine needle aspirate (FNA).
The target column indicates whether the tumor is **malignant (cancerous)** or **benign (non-cancerous)**.

---

Machine learning algorithms require clean, numerical, and scaled data.
Steps:
- Handle missing values (if any)
- Find duplicates
- Encode target labels (Malignant = 1, Benign = 0)
- Split dataset into training and testing sets

Looks like there is an extra comma at the end of the columns.
This creates an empty column called "Unnamed: 32".
We shall delete it.

Given the model (best) will give us probabilities for malignant tumor (between 0 and 1).
It might seem
natural to choose 0.5 as a threshold for positive result, i.e., we might
naively want to call a result positive if probability for positive is >= 0.5.

But a serious diagnosis such as breast cancer should have low threshold to avoid
high number of false negatives.
We want to be absolutely sure that a negative result by the model is truely negative.
Also since the ML algorithms output will be reviewed by professional it is prudent
to keep the threshold low.

In other words we want our model to have **high recall**.

To get some ideas about the threshold, below we check the precision recall curve
on the test set.

P = (actual) positive data points

N = (actual) negative data points

TP = True positive  : a data point marked positive by the model that is actually positive

FP = False positive : a data point marked positive by the model that is actually negative

FN = False negative : a data point marked negative by the model that is actually positive

Precision = TP / (TP + FP) :
Of the points the model called positive, how many were truly positive?
Here TP + FP are the number of data points the model marked positive.

Recall = TP / (TP + FN) :
Of the actually positive points, how many did the model correctly find?
Here TP + FN are the number of data points that are actually positive.

Since this is a medical application, we don't want the model to miss positives.
We care about high recall, about 99%.
Let's find a threshold that achieves this.
But **we shouldn't use the test set** for choosing this threshold.
This might lead to **overfitting** to the test set.

Let's use cross validation (CV) again for doing this.
More precisely, CV splits the train data (X_train) into CV_train, CV_validation (with different random state than before).
We train out best model on CV_train. On CV_validation the model gives probabilities for positive results.

Now, there are two ways to proceed:
    1. We compare this CV_validation probabilities to relevant y_train to find
    a threshold for 99% recall. We can take a median of all these thresholds
    found from the CV splits.

    2. We can take all these probabilities and stack them to get an array, (the same as y_test)
    which we compare to y_test to get a threshold for 99% recall.

The second method is more robust for medical applications, it collects
validation signal on the whole training set (each point predicted by a model that didnâ€™t see it).
